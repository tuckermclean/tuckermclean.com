<section>
    <p>I'm not one to toot my own horn, but I come by it honestly. There's one thing you should know about me: I care
        deeply about what I do, how I do it, and the people I work with. I see systems--whether technical or
        organizational--as living flows. Every component matters. Every interaction must land on time, on target, and on
        budget. Wherever I've worked, I've made sure of that.</p>
    <p>It all started in 1990 with my first computer. I typed BASIC programs, crafted games, and pushed the limits of
        those early machines. That spark of curiosity grew into a career. I've designed systems, automated processes,
        and solved problems with resourcefulness. I am relentlessly focused on making things work better.</p>
    <p>My career began supporting dial-up internet customers over the phone. I stood out with my personal
        touch--balancing the customer's experience with the moment's technical realities. Since then, I've evolved into
        a quiet force in IT: someone who builds and solves, who speaks only when there's something worth saying. When I
        do, the room listens.</p>
    <p>At <strong>Intel</strong>, I wore many hats and saw solutions where others saw chaos. When our team faced a lab move that left us
        without network infrastructure, I built a complete environment from scratch. I repurposed servers, ran 100G
        fiber, and configured Cisco and Extreme switches. I set up a dynamic PXE boot environment, automated OS
        deployments with Python, and built firewall rules for our lab bastion server. The result?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I <strong>saved time</strong>, <strong>cut costs</strong>, and <strong>freed up</strong> engineers for
            meaningful work.</li>
        <li>I delivered <strong>thousands of dollars in savings</strong> by using equipment we already had.</li>
        <li>I built a foundation that <strong>empowered the team</strong> to focus on what mattered: <strong>customer
                satisfaction</strong> and <strong>results</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But my work didn't stop at building systems. I became the go-to for untangling technical challenges, earning
        trust across teams for my ability to troubleshoot, automate, and document complex processes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I worked on special projects; i.e., I analyzed Wireshark traces to resolve issues at a global retailer's
            network lab.</li>
        <li>I mastered Intel's SCM process to manage bespoke firmware and driver releases.</li>
        <li>I drove software legal compliance workflows and streamlined delivery pipelines as the acting SWLC liaison.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have a holistic mindset for systems and tools, with decades of experience using <strong>Linux distros</strong>
        like RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Arch, Amazon Linux, and Mariner. I also know modern tools like
        <strong>WSL</strong> and open-source automation with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Ansible</strong>. But
        beyond tools, my strength is in seeing the big picture. I understand how components, people, and processes
        interact.</p>
        <p>In the last few months, I've expanded my expertise into the <strong>cloud</strong> with AWS. This has added an exciting new dimension to my technical toolkit. Here's what I've been working on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I've built <strong>serverless architectures</strong> with AWS Lambda, integrating API Gateway to create scalable, event-driven solutions.</li>
            <li>I'm managing <strong>Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)</strong> with Terraform, streamlining resource deployments across environments.</li>
            <li>I've developed secure multi-account setups with <strong>AWS Organizations</strong>, ensuring compliance and efficient resource sharing.</li>
            <li>To enhance automation, I've incorporated <strong>DynamoDB</strong> for backend storage and leveraged <strong>S3</strong> with <strong>CloudFront</strong> for fast and reliable web hosting.</li>
            <li>I'm implementing <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong> to accelerate development cycles while maintaining high-quality standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, I'm combining decades of experience with the scalability and power of AWS. Whether it's designing resilient systems, troubleshooting the unexpected, or bridging the gap between technology and business needs, I thrive where the technical meets the practical. I connect systems, people, and ideas, ensuring everything flows smoothly, reliably, and efficiently.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for someone who sees the forest <em>and</em> the trees, let's talk. I bring curiosity,
            expertise, and a track record of getting things done. I've got niche skills, serious Google-fu, and a whole lot
            of heart for what I do. After over three decades in tech, I'm just as excited today as I was in 1990.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>TM‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
