    <p>At <strong>Intel</strong>, I engineered solutions where others saw chaos:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built a lab network from scratch--100G fiber, DHCP, PXE, and automated deployments with Python.</li>
        <li>Saved <strong>thousands</strong>💰💸 by repurposing hardware and freeing engineers to focus on results.</li>
        <li>Untangled critical issues with Wireshark, streamlined firmware releases, and drove compliance workflows.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm fluent in <strong>Linux</strong> (RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Arch), <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Node.JS</strong>, <strong>Terraform</strong> and <strong>Ansible</strong>, and I bring a holistic view of
        systems--technical and organizational. I see the big picture, find inefficiencies, and deliver reliable
        solutions that stand the test of time.</p>
    <p>Now, I have expanded into <strong>AWS</strong> to bring scalable, efficient systems into the cloud. <strong><a href="https://github.com/tuckermclean/tuckermclean.com">This website</a> and the AWS cloud <a href="https://github.com/tuckermclean/tuckermclean.com_backend">infrastructure-as-code</a> supporting it are available for your perusal on GitHub.</strong></p>
    <p>I'd like you to read about <a href="/writings/posts/my-cloud-portfolio-journey/">my cloud journey</a>.</p>
    <p>If you need someone who sees both the forest <em>and</em> the trees--and gets things done--let's talk.</p>
