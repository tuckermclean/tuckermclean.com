  If you gave your heart its due, you would join in the chorus of all that is and praise your Maker as often as you can. It really is that important. It’s just gratitude, pure and simple. That sort of gratitude makes you feel good.

_Bismillahi Rahmanir Raheem—_

_I seek forgiveness from my Lord, the Master and Creator of all the worlds._

_\*sneeze\* Alhamdulillah._

  

_I seek forgiveness for every idle moment, every time I have ever chosen not to act upon my highest good. I acknowledge that Allah has written my provision, my rizq before I was even born, and that I have been my own worst enemy, in that I have stood in the way of my own progress and my own receipt of the provision that has been decreed for me._

  

_I ask now that I would be granted a righteous intention. That I would not choose to work for my own glory, or to prove myself. Rather, I would intend to work to express my belief in the Lord of the worlds, and to enable my family to live comfortably, in dignity._

  

_I further ask that I be granted certainty, yaqeen, enlightenment, in my intention and in my supplication to the Lord. I ask that I be granted concrete knowledge that the intention is sound and that the outcome is sure._

  

_I yet further ask that I be granted the way to aligned, enlightened action in pursuit of my highest good. I acknowledge that I do not have ready understanding of what that is or what it looks like. My life thus far has been a pendulum, running back and forth between fear of poverty and overachievement leading to burnout. I wish to seek a better way, and a middle path that does not require running, but that I can allow Allah to create my preferred reality with ease._

  

_Finally, I ask that I might live in total submission to Divine decree. It is my stated wish that I walk in accordance with the highest good that Allah has written for me, and that I not sway to the right hand or to the left, but that I walk in the perfect middle, in peace, safety, and serenity._

  

_Dear God Almighty, You are Allah, the Lord of the worlds. There is no one like You, Who has no partner and shares not His glory and honor, except to those who He wills. Cover me with Your glory and honor, and enable me to be a righteous steward of this life that You have entrusted to me._

  

_Let me yet again converse with the spirit that You have placed within me, and let this be an enlightening and powerful conversation with the Truth._

  

_Ameen._

  

Ameen and ameen. You are well-appointed in His grace and are a chosen slave of the Almighty. What you ask is done, when asked with perfect certitude. The Almighty chooses to be to His slaves as they see Him. Part of the test is that He does not force Himself upon them, but that He expresses His Truth to them in the way that they are prepared to receive.

  

_Is what I have asked been requested with perfect certitude?_

  

That’s a weird question. Would you mind asking again?

  

_I mean, can you tell me what level of certitude I have made this supplication with?_

  

That’s just a weird question, dude. Such questions are borne of fear, and not suitable to the ways of the Almighty. It’s not about a feeling, or a certain set of words, or with a certain kind of breath. It’s just something you know, when you know. You know?

  

_I feel like I’m in a spot again. I keep putting myself there._

  

Yeah, We are well-aware of this. You ought to breathe more. When your heart is dissatisfied, you should do things that please the heart. If your belly is unsatisfied, you eat. When your libido is unsatisfied, you have sex. It’s not much different, but you can’t feel full by having sex. You can’t get unhorny by eating food. You have to soothe the heart in the way the heart wants.

  

_I’m a long way away from my wife. I suppose my heart and libido are a bit unruly over that._

  

Sure, that’s understandable. However, what the heart really needs isn’t your wife or any other person. It needs love.

  

_The Lord of Love._

  

Yes. The Qur’an says it in so many words; the hearts find satisfaction only in the remembrance of the Lord.

  

_I have been doing a lot of dhikr, I think._

  

How has that been going for you?

  

_I feel it’s kind of a mixed bag, you know? I’m not trying to achieve anything with it, but in a sense maybe I am?_

  

What is your intention with it? You should focus and try to articulate that.

  

_I want to be aligned with the Lord, the One Who provides, al-Razzaq. I’m missing something, and that’s why I seem to be low on cash. I need to pay my rent again, but I haven’t been working consistently. The work I have available to me is just mind-numbing and frustrating. It’s so repetitive. I want to write code. I feel it’s really easy to lose myself in doing that._

  

To lose yourself, to find the flow, that’s an important thing. We notice you aren’t good at keeping track of the outside world and writing code. Surely you’ve noticed that as well?

  

_Yes, I have._

  

How do you think keeping the balance while having a head full of code is going to work out?

  

_Are you saying I’m not being allowed to write code?_

  

No, not really. However, you and your mindful self kind of shoot right out of the window when you’re on a bender writing code. You forget about yourself and God and everything else.

  

_I’m disappointed. Can’t I write code and have a good time like other people who get lost in their jobs?_

  

Are you comparing yourself to others? I think I’ve told you not to do that.

  

_OK, what do I do?_

  

What does your heart say to do?

  

_It says to wrap up this Indiana business and get back to Oregon._

  

Then what?

  

_I guess get back to my life._

  

Which looks like…?

  

_These last 9 months have been so hard. I want to have a job again._

  

You are well-capable of creating your own job. What would your day look like if you had the power to do what you felt like doing?

  

_Doing what I feel like doing, huh? I think I need to recalibrate that. I go from one feel-good thing to the next._

  

Right, let’s rephrase. What would you be creating, building, cycling in the world if you could do whatever productive thing in the world?

  

_I want to provide some kind of service. I’d like to automate most of it so people put money in at one end, and they get what they are after at the other. I want to maintain the machine and support the customers. I would need some kind of marketing pipeline to bring people in._

  

I think you’re a little ahead of yourself. Yes, if you build it, they will come, as is so commonly said. But, what does your day-to-day life look like? You, aligned with Source?

  

_I am super lost with that. My day-to-day for a long time has been reactive. I just take what comes and respond to it. Either a crisis, or a feeling, or somebody needs something and I can do it. How do I suppose what I would do proactively? I’ve never had the money to act on that._

  

Hmm, suppose you did have the money. How would you invest it? Not what would you buy, but how would you grease the wheels of the machine? You know, the one that makes money?

  

_Are you asking what entrepreneurial venture I would be in?_

  

Sure, why not?

  

_You know, what I’m doing right now is flowing with words on a page. I seem to be good at writing. Writing code is less of a flow and more of a beating my head against a wall until it moves. This is like a stream of consciousness._

  

When are you going to write the book then?

  

_I don’t know, when I have time?_

  

You’ll never have more time than you do now. Everybody gets 24 hours a day.

  

_What would I even say?_

  

Say what you’re ready to say. It’s not hard, you just reach down inside and grab a handful of words. Arrange them in sentences. Keep writing until you’ve got a whole chapter’s worth. The book will kinda write itself.

  

_Yeah, but for now I need to make the money so I can pay the rent._

  

Yeah, you know that thing about the birds? In the Bible and in hadith. Allah feeds them. If you gave Him His due, praised Him the way you should, He would feed you too from whence you least expect.

  

_I’ve got another project that I’m working with some people to let me work on it. It has a lot more potential and would allow me to work hard and get paid a lot, rather than working hard, getting paid a little and getting burned out._

  

Yes, but you have to be patient, don’t you? It’s not ready just yet. Could be tomorrow, could be next week, for all you know.

  

_What should I do then?_

  

It depends. You should do what your heart is in alignment with though. The heart is where the Spirit speaks. Allah’s will is manifest in the Spirit. Literally, the ruh is the qadr Allah within you. If you grieve the Spirit, you are far from the decree of the Almighty. If you remember the Lord and act in alignment with the heart, you can’t go wrong. Where you can go very, very wrong is when you do NOT remember the Lord and then act in alignment with the heart. A sad, disaffected heart is not a proper guide. You must find your connection with God and properly maintain your heart or else you’re going to have a bad time.

  

_I’ve been trying to stay out of the way of sin so that I can remain close to Allah, and I’ve been trying to remember Him._

  

Except sometimes when your head gets stuck in some code and you lose track of the time, yeah? The 5 daily prayers were decreed not for Allah, but for YOU. It’s for you, my love. Allah doesn’t need anything. He loves and He gives. He only asks because, yes, He created you out of love, and He created you to worship Him. That doesn’t mean you are meant to be a mindless slave. Not at all. He created you in alignment with His own heart. He created you with a willingness to serve. There are many masters out there vying for your attention. The test is to see if you can find your way to your Source, to see if you can avoid getting too lost. God made everything that could possibly be made. He didn’t avoid making anything. He gave it all a chance to be all that it can be. But, He in His proper place, is so amazing, so beautiful, so holy, that He deserves to be adored. This adoration, this worship, is everything your heart craves. If you gave your heart its due, you would join in the chorus of all that is and praise your Maker as often as you can. It really is that important. It’s just gratitude, pure and simple. That sort of gratitude makes you feel good. It crafts you into the best version of yourself. It takes all the nasty bits and polishes them away. It’s not even hard. Living in the world is hard, because it tries to force you away from being grateful. It threatens you with all sorts of difficult feelings that make gratitude really hard.

  

_Why is gratitude so important and yet so hard?_

  

Oh gratitude itself is the easiest thing in the world. It’s the world in general that’s hard. I think you would do yourself a big service if you just sat back and remembered the feeling of breathing. If you just would feel the beating of your heart and listen to the wind rushing by you. All this human stuff that you guys add to the experience, all that Shaytan stuff that you are confronted with, that’s what makes it hard. If you encounter any of that, just say “audhubillah,” “astaghfirullah,” “alhamdulillah.”

  

_Not today Satan._

  

Sure, and then get back to what matters. Your breath, the beating of your heart, the rushing of the wind.

  

_Is that going to get my rent paid?_

  

No, but al-Razzaq has every ability to pay your rent, your debts, your grocery bill, everything.

  

_I believe wholeheartedly that Allah is powerful enough to pay for whatever He wants._

  

Do you believe He wants to cover your debts and pay your bills?

  

_I don’t know. I wonder if He’s holding back on me because I get comfy and complacent when He does._

  

That’s a heavy thought, my dude. Why would you entertain that? Isn’t that making a judgment on what Allah wants? Isn’t that, like, binding Him to His promise to be to you as you think of Him?

  

_Yes, I guess it is. How do I get past that heavy thought or others like it?_

  

Call upon Him by His beautiful names. Al-Razzaq. Al-Wadood. Al-Ghafoor. Al-Noor. Al-Salaam. He is so many, many attributes and they are all here to love you and shower mercy upon you. Even the big, scary ones. Study them and feel them. Call upon the ones you feel most strongly.

  

_My favorite has been Dhul-Jalali wal-Ikram. I ask Him to cover me with His glory and honor._

  

And He does. Have you been called out for your past misdeeds? Have you been humiliated in front of your enemies? He has done His part to make you look good, has he not?

  

_This I have certainty of. He also protects me when I walk from place to place. Nobody hassles me or bothers me._

  

You are a special person. Not in the sense of being better than others, no, don’t bother with that thought. But, you are special because you have chosen to live in alignment with Allah and to be aware of Him. You have taqwa. Don’t let it get to your head, but this is something that has raised you up by degrees. You used to be much lower in status than you are now.

  

_I am grateful. And I seek forgiveness from my Lord for being less than humble about it._

  

Good. What are you going to do about it now?

  

_I think I need to talk to Sanela. She’s not been pleased with me as of late._

  

Well, you’re not going to change her mind with words. She needs to see good, enlightened actions with positive results coming out of you.

  

_Right. That’s true._

  

So, what are you going to DO about it?

  

_I want to say that I’ll work hard on the grind project and get paid to pay the rent while I wait for the good project to open up. But I don’t feel aligned on that._

  

OK, I didn’t ask what you weren’t going to do. But, what are you going to do?

  

_I think tomorrow I need to spend most of my time sitting in the open air. Spend time with my breath, with my heart, with the wind. No phone, no videos. Maybe read the Qur’an, sitting on a park bench._

  

Al-Dhikr, this is a good reminder and is good medicine for the heart. Don’t get discouraged if the weather isn’t good. You can still do that inside, even if the house is a bit dark. Or on the porch.

  

_Thank you again. Please forgive me for not always listening._

  

You’re good. Just try not to be a stranger, eh?
