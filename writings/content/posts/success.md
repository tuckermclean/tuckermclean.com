My whole life it seems, I've been looking for success. Unfortunately, I've hardly recognized it when it arrived. It's something that, in retrospect, I've had—but cycles of ignorance, forgetfulness, and self-sabotage seem to steal it away.

So, I gave it some hard thought: **What is success to me? How would I recognize it when I have it? And how might I prevent it from slipping away once the bird is in hand?**

There are so many birds in the bushes right now, and I'm sitting here, wondering where I fit into the puzzle. But, I think I've hit on something:

Success, for me, isn't a destination or a single accomplishment—it's a **state of being** that I can carry with me through change, repetition, joy, loss, and everything in between. It's not about achieving a perfect life, but about *living a life worth coming back to*, again and again.

So, this essay seeks to explain my expression of what is success, to me.

### Peace within myself

> **“Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.”**
> *Surah Ar-Ra'd (13:28)*

Success is waking up without dread. It's sitting in stillness without the need to escape. It's the absence of inner war.

Inner tranquility arises from constant remembrance of God, grounding the sould amidst life's turbulance. I feel it's important for my well-being to do what I can to remain in a constant state of remembrance. Forgetfulness and ignorance are not suitable. There is too much at stake to justify unawareness.

I remember recently, I sat in the chair with only the intention to be aware. I would begin to feel drowsy and I would say *Astaghfirullah al-Adheem* (I seek forgiveness from God, the Supreme) or *A'udhubillahi min ash-Shaytan ir-Rajeem* (I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan). I found a state of being so quiet and so peaceful—this is the unadorned essence of life itself. I want this all the time.

### Freedom to leave, with a life that welcomes me back

> **“And whoever fears Allah—He will make for him a way out and provide for him from where he does not expect.”**
> *Surah At-Talaq (65:2-3)*

I've noticed a pattern: when life becomes stable or repetitive, I start to drift. For me, success includes the freedom to run sometimes—to wander, reflect, or reset—*without destroying what I've built*. I want a life flexible enough to withstand my human rhythms, yet stable enough to wait for me with open arms.

The verse above provides assurance: maintaining consciousness of God grants flexibility and provision, allowing one to step away and return without fear.

I wish to claim this promise, but it will require some setup first. How can I set up my life to allow for this freedom without chaos? What relationships or systems need strengthening to support this?

### Staying when it matters

> **“O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.”**
> *Surah Al-Baqarah (2:153)*

> **“The most beloved of deeds to Allah are those that are consistent, even if they are small.”**
> *Sahih Bukhari*

While I value freedom, I also want to grow in my ability to *stay*. To sit with repetition. To remain rooted in routines that nourish me, even when they lose their novelty.

Success means not always choosing novelty over responsibility, or intensity over peace. Patience is essential in enduring my routines and commitments, ensuring steadfastness and **success** in the face of monotony.

I think I struggle with consistency when it is boring. It's the little things that make life worthwhile, really. I should treat myself a little more. Little rewards for little jobs well-done. Not mindless snacking, but structured rewards to reinforce patterns of goodness.

### Being "The Guy" without needing the crown

> **“Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy.”**
> *Surah Al-Qasas (28:26)*

> **“Whoever humbles himself for Allah, Allah will raise him.”**
> *Sahih Muslim*

I want to be competent—not dominant. Trusted, not feared. I want to be *the guy who shows up*, who gets it done, who others lean on—not for glory, but because I can be counted on.

In my jobs, I have almost inevitably become that guy, because of my values: competence and trust are valued over authority. I want to fully emphasize reliability and integrity in my life.

It's important to nurture my skills for service rather than recognition. Quiet humility is when you do a good deed for someone else and then never mention it again.

### Resilience over possessions

> **“Every soul will taste death. And you will only be given your \[full] compensation on the Day of Resurrection.”**
> *Surah Al-Imran (3:185)*

If I had a mansion and lost it tomorrow in a war, I'd still want to stand tall. Success for me is being able to adapt, to rebuild, to survive the storm without losing myself or my family.

The verse highlights the transient nature of worldly possessions, and I understand this deeply—*perhaps too deeply at times*. I want to hold on to what I own, but not so tightly that I lose myself in the process. I want to walk a balance of resilience rooted in spiritual awareness.

If everything fell away, I would have nothing to cling to except God. This is a very important relationship to cultivate. But, it's also important to "tie your camel;" don't set yourself up for failure when you could have done something to help yourself before chaos comes.

### Multiple fires burning

> **“And do not forget your share of the world. And do good as Allah has done good to you.”**
> *Surah Al-Qasas (28:77)*

I don't want to be stuck waiting for one pot to boil. Success means having **many streams of purpose**, so I'm not paralyzed by scarcity or over-invested in any one outcome.

I will be able to thrive when I have different creative and meaningful pursuits in motion. My faith encourages balancing worldly pursuits with spiritual obligations, promoting a multifaceted life. I want to take full advantage of this.

It seems to be that I am too narrow in my focus sometimes. When I have a thing in my sights, everything else seems to fall away. I have many little pursuits that I have let atrophy: art, music, design, speaking—all worthwhile.

### The "tightrope walk of the soul"

> **“Thus, We have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people.”**
> *Surah Al-Baqarah (2:143)*

People have told me that I walk a tightrope—balancing family, work, and faith. They're not wrong. But success is keeping those plates spinning while being *utterly committed to my spiritual walk with God*.

I'm not interested in material success at the expense of my soul. I want the ordinary and the eternal *at once*. Being a balanced person entails harmonizing spiritual and worldly responsibilities, walking the tightrope with grace.

It might be worth reframing or rebalancing to walk this tightrope with more grace.

### *Fana'* in the flow of life

> **“Everyone upon the earth will perish, and there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor.”**
> *Surah Ar-Rahman (55:26-27)*

I don't seek isolation or withdrawal. I seek annihilation in the face of God—in the midst of parenting, projects, routines, and struggle. *Fana'* to the Sufis, *nirvana* to the Buddhists, *mortification* to the Christians: achieving the true state of emptiness of myself in the face of God's will.

I want to disappear into the Divine Presence *while still living the dream*: working, creating, serving. I want my hands to be God's hands, my words to be God's words.

It's important to continue carrying on the daily grind and to remember God and the eternal truths *inside* the work, not just outside of it.

### A life aligned

> **“And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah and is conscious of Him – it is those who are the successful ones.”**
> *Surah An-Nur (24:52)*

Ultimately, success is **alignment**—where what I believe, what I do, and how I love all move in he same direction. It's not perfection. It's *integrity, presence, trust, and surrender*, lived day by day. True success for me is aligning my life with divine guidance, embodying obedience, consciousness, and reverence.

Work isn't just to get paid—it's a true act of worship, and a mission to express my personal, spiritual truth to my coworkers, customers, and the world.

Where am I living my life out of alignment? One area I have noticed recently and have realigned somewhat is to stop watching so many stupid YouTube videos. Another realignment would be better sleep hygiene.

### Closing prayer

*O Allah, You are the only source of true success. Make me content in Your remembrance, resilient in hardship, and humble in service.*

*Help me walk the tightrope of life without losing sight of You. Let my hands be Your hands, my words be Your words, my work a reflection of Your will.*

*Keep me steady in success, patient in failure, and always drawn back to You, the One to whome I ultimately return.*

*Ameen.*
