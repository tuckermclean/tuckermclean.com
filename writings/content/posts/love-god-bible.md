This is a particularly important topic for me personally, having grown up in [a tradition that places special emphasis on the inerrancy of the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church). Although Seventh-day Adventism acknowledges the possibility of copyist errors in the biblical text, it still holds the Bible as the ultimate authority on God’s plan of salvation:

> “The Bible is written by inspired men, but it is not God’s mode of thought and expression. It is that of humanity... God, as a writer, is not represented. Men will often say such an expression is not like God. But God has not put Himself in words... The writers of the Bible were God’s penmen, not His pen.”
>
> *Selected Messages, Book 1, p. 21*

In this article, I intend to delve deeply into the topic of the Bible's divine inspiration and fully elucidate my position on Scripture.

Out of respect for all prophets, I will occasionally use the phrase "peace be upon him/them" throughout.

How could I possibly love God, and yet think the Bible is flawed?
=================================================================

Is this a loaded question? I don't think so. I will try to demonstrate the following points with evidences from the Bible itself:

### Why I Love God and All His Messengers, Yet Believe the Bible is Flawed

#### Unity of God

* **God is One and Eternal**, the Creator of all things. This is a core belief I share with Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).

#### Relationship to Messengers

* **I honor every prophet sent by God**—from Adam to Noah, from Abraham to Moses, from Jesus to Muhammad (may God's peace be upon them). They all called to worship the One True God and no other.

#### On Scripture

* **The Bible contains truth**, but it also contains the words of men—scribes, editors, kings, and unknown authors. These words are not all the Word of God, nor are they presented as such. However, many of these words are presented as the words of God, and I personally can't get behind it.

* **God never loses His Word**, but humans misquote, mistranslate, and reinterpret it. The Bible as we have it today is not the same as the Injeel given to Jesus, nor the Tawrat given to Moses, to use the Qur'anic terms.

#### The Nature of Jesus

* **Jesus himself prayed to God** and submitted to Him, calling Him *my God* ([John 20:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A17&version=NRSVUE)). He never claimed to be God in his own words.

* **The doctrine of the Trinity**, the deity of Christ, and original sin are not the explicit teachings of Moses or Jesus in the Bible; rather, these developed as doctrine in later councils and Christian thought, influenced by Greek philosophy.

#### Paul's Letters

* **Paul’s letters are not the Gospel**. Paul's letters are treated as inspired scripture by most Christians, yet Paul never met Jesus in person—apart from a reported vision ([Acts 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209&version=NRSVUE))—and at times openly argued with those who did ([Galatians 2:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A11-21&version=NRSVUE)).

#### The Qur'an as God's Word

* **God’s final Word is the Qur’an**, revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him). It intends to confirm the truth in previous scriptures and correct the errors introduced over time.

* **The Qur’an defends Jesus’ honor**—that he was born of a virgin, performed miracles, and is the Messiah, but was not crucified nor called people to worship him, according to the account found in the Qur’an.

#### Jesus, the Prophets, and Monotheism

* **I strive to follow Jesus' example closely** by rejecting idolatry and submitting to God alone, just as he (peace be upon him) did.

#### Reason & Understanding

* **Loving God means using reason** as God commands ([Isaiah 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%201%3A18&version=NRSVUE), [Qur’an 8:22](https://quran.com/en/al-anfal/22)). Faith is not blind—it is rooted in truth and sincerity.

* **I invite mutual understanding**, not one-sided preaching. I am willing to read Christian texts, but I ask the same in return. Let us seek understanding and truth together.

Without further ado, let's get on with it. *Bismillah (In God's name)*

Proof from the Bible That the Bible Is Not Perfect or Directly from God
=======================================================================

Upon close examination, the claim that the Bible is the perfect, preserved Word of God faces significant difficulties—and even the Bible’s own texts raise important questions about this claim. While many Christians assert that the Old and New Testaments together form God’s two divine witnesses, this claim has no scriptural basis and is difficult to support based on issues of consistency, preservation, and authorship.

Let’s begin where Christian theology itself claims its foundation: the resurrection of Jesus. If God’s plan for salvation hinges upon this singular moment, we would expect its documentation to be clear and consistent. Instead, we find four irreconcilable accounts. In [Matthew 28:1–10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A1-10&version=NRSVUE), two women encounter a visible angel who rolls away the stone. In [Mark 16:1–8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A1-8&version=NRSVUE), it’s three women who meet a young man already sitting inside the tomb. [Luke 24:1–12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A1-12&version=NRSVUE) claims there were two men in dazzling garments, and in [John 20:1–18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A1-18&version=NRSVUE), Mary Magdalene comes alone, finds the stone moved, and speaks to Jesus after mistaking him for a gardener. Many Christians have proposed ways to reconcile these differences, but for me, they highlight the complex human process behind the formation of these accounts. If God is not the author of confusion, as [1 Corinthians 14:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014%3A33&version=NRSVUE) asserts, how do we explain these contradictions?

Of course, Christian theologians have attempted to harmonize these accounts, but these efforts appear forced in the face of a plain, honest reading of the text.

The confusion deepens with the genealogies of Jesus. [Matthew 1:1–16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%201%3A1-16&version=NRSVUE) gives one lineage for Joseph, while [Luke 3:23–38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%203%3A23-38&version=NRSVUE) gives a completely different one. They cannot both be true. This is not a small error; it directly undermines prophetic claims about Jesus' heritage.

Then there is the issue of lost texts. If the Bible is complete and preserved, why does it repeatedly reference other books that no longer exist? [Numbers 21:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2021%3A14&version=NRSVUE) mentions “The Book of the Wars of the Lord.” [Joshua 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2010%3A13&version=NRSVUE) cites “The Book of Jasher.” [1 Chronicles 29:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%2029%3A29&version=NRSVUE) refers to records written by Samuel, Nathan, and Gad. [Colossians 4:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%204%3A16&version=NRSVUE) speaks of a letter to the Laodiceans—gone. [1 Corinthians 5:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%205%3A9&version=NRSVUE) references a previous letter Paul wrote. These missing documents are not trivial—they are acknowledged as once being part of the inspired testimony.

Even what remains in the Bible is tainted by human insertion. [Jeremiah 8:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%208%3A8&version=NRSVUE) warns: “How can you say, ‘We are wise, for we have the law of the Lord,’ when the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely?” The Bible tells us its transmission was not immune to corruption.

This is not surprising when we examine how the biblical authors understood their own writing. [Luke 1:1–4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201%3A1-4&version=NRSVUE) openly admits that his gospel was a human effort, compiled from stories handed down by others. Paul in [1 Corinthians 7:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207%3A12&version=NRSVUE) says plainly, “I, not the Lord.” In [2 Corinthians 11:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2011%3A17&version=NRSVUE), he speaks “not with the Lord’s authority, but as a fool.” Yet his letters are treated by the Church as if they were the direct speech of God.

The contradictions don’t stop at narration—they extend to theology. [James 1:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201%3A13&version=NRSVUE) says God tempts no one, yet [Genesis 22:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2022%3A1&version=NRSVUE) (especially [in the KJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2022%3A1&version=KJV)) says God tempted Abraham. [Psalm 119:160](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119%3A160&version=NRSVUE) and [Isaiah 40:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040%3A8&version=NRSVUE) declare that God's Word stands forever. [Hebrews 8:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%208%3A13&version=NRSVUE) claims the first covenant was made obsolete. [John 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A18&version=NRSVUE) insists no one has ever seen God, yet [Exodus 33:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2033%3A11&version=NRSVUE) says Moses spoke with Him face to face. [Genesis 32:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2032%3A30&version=NRSVUE) records Jacob claiming he saw God. [Acts 9:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209%3A7&version=NRSVUE) says Paul’s companions heard a voice; [Acts 22:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022%3A9&version=NRSVUE) says they did not.

How is it that such apparent contradictions exist if the revelation is perfect and direct from God?

Like other faith traditions, the process of collecting and preserving the Bible involved human choices. However, the extent and nature of debate over the biblical canon stands in contrast to what we Muslims believe about the Qur’an’s preservation. [Revelation 22:18–19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A18-19&version=NRSVUE), often cited as a warning not to add to Scripture, is ironically part of a book that wasn’t universally accepted when that warning was written.

Let’s examine the idea that the Old and New Testaments are “God’s two witnesses.” [Revelation 11:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011%3A3&version=NRSVUE) clearly speaks of two human witnesses, not books. They wear sackcloth. They prophesy. They are killed, then raised. The Bible itself does not support the idea that it and itself form a twofold divine witness.

Now consider the law. [Matthew 5:17–19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A17-19&version=NRSVUE) quotes Jesus as affirming that the law remains fully intact, down to the last letter. Paul says otherwise. In [Romans 6:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206%3A14&version=NRSVUE), [Galatians 2:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202%3A16&version=NRSVUE), and [Colossians 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202%3A14&version=NRSVUE), Paul insists the law is abolished, nailed to the cross. Paul even calls his message “my gospel” in [Romans 2:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202%3A16&version=NRSVUE) and [2 Timothy 2:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202%3A8&version=NRSVUE)—a message I find to be at odds with both the Torah and with Jesus’ own words.

Jesus never once clearly claimed to be God. [Mark 10:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010%3A18&version=NRSVUE): “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.” In [John 17:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017%3A3&version=NRSVUE), he says the Father is “the only true God.” In [Matthew 26:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026%3A39&version=NRSVUE), he falls on his face and prays to God, clearly distinguishing himself from Him.

Even prophecy itself fails the test. [Ezekiel 26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2026&version=NRSVUE) predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will destroy Tyre completely—he didn’t. Alexander the Great did, much later. [Jonah 3:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jonah%203%3A4&version=NRSVUE) announces the destruction of Nineveh in forty days. It never happened.

The Torah itself refutes the core Christian doctrine of atonement. [Deuteronomy 24:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2024%3A16&version=NRSVUE) says no one can be punished for another’s sins. [Hosea 6:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%206%3A6&version=NRSVUE) and [Micah 6:6–8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah%206%3A6-8&version=NRSVUE) say God desires mercy, not sacrifice. If God does not contradict Himself, then the theology of the New Testament cannot be from Him.

Yes, Christians see the atoning sacrifice of Christ on the cross as a fulfillment of the law of Moses (peace be upon him)—but, from a straightforward reading of the Torah, substitution of punishment one for another is explicitly denied.

So what does this mean?

It means the Bible is not a single book from God. It is a collection of writings, some inspired, some corrupted, some preserved, many altered. Its transmission was not guarded, its content not consistent, and its message not unified. It contains truth—but it is not The Truth in its entirety. The notion that the Old and New Testaments together are “God’s two witnesses” is a later human interpretation, rather than a biblical claim.

If God is truly perfect, His Word should reflect that perfection—unaltered, unambiguous, and undivided. While the Bible does not consistently meet these criteria, the Qur’an presents itself as an unchanged, preserved revelation, memorized in its entirety by millions, and upholding the pure monotheism of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.

The Bible itself stands as evidence that it cannot be what so many claim it is. It is not God's final Word. It is not a perfect witness. And it is not above scrutiny.

Evidence for the Claim that the Qur'an is the Preserved Word of God
===================================================================

The Qur'an, in summary:

1. **Claims to be the direct Word of God**, not the words of men.
2. **Asserts its own preservation by God**.
3. **Demonstrates internal consistency**.
4. **Contains fulfilled prophecies** that support its divine origin.

Very bold claims! The Bible itself even hesitates to make these claims, preferring to say that it is "God-breathed" and written by the hands of men.

Each section following includes relevant ayat (verses) from the Qur’an to back up the claims.

### 1. **The Qur’an is the Word of God, Not the Word of Men**

The Qur’an does not merely claim inspiration—it explicitly presents itself as the *verbatim speech* of God, revealed through the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon them both).

> **“Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder, and indeed, We will be its Guardian.”**
> *Surah al-Hijr (15:9)*

> **“This is the revelation of the Book from God, the Mighty, the Wise. It is We who have sent down the Book to you in truth.”**
> *Surah az-Zumar (39:1–2)*

> **“Say, \[O Muhammad], 'If mankind and the jinn gathered together to produce the like of this Qur’an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each support the other.'”**
> *Surah al-Isra (17:88)*

These verses assert that the Qur’an is not authored by Muhammad (peace be upon him), nor is it a product of human effort. It is not “inspired” in the vague sense, but rather *directly revealed speech*.

### 2. **The Qur’an Declares Its Own Preservation by God**

The Qur’an uniquely emphasizes and repeats its own divine preservation in clear terms. No other major scripture contains a direct promise of preservation by its author. The Qur’an does.

> **“Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an and indeed, We will be its Guardian.”**
> *Surah al-Hijr (15:9)*

> **“Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or behind it—it is a revelation from the Wise and Praiseworthy.”**
> *Surah Fussilat (41:42)*

For over 1400 years, this claim has proven true. The Qur’an is recited, memorized, and transmitted in a living tradition, identical in every corner of the Muslim world, letter for letter. Even orientalist scholars like [Arthur Jeffery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Jeffery) and [Theodor Nöldeke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_N%C3%B6ldeke) admitted that the Qur’an's text is uniquely stable among ancient scriptures.

### 3. **The Qur’an Possesses Internal Consistency and Coherence**

Unlike the Bible, which contains contradictions and uncertain authorship, the Qur’an **challenges readers to find inconsistency**—and claims that this consistency is a proof of divine origin.

> **“Do they not then ponder upon the Qur’an? Had it been from anyone other than God, they would have found in it much contradiction.”**
> *Surah an-Nisa (4:82)*

In fact, the Qur’an often anticipates its critics. When it repeats a story (such as that of Moses \[peace be upon him] or Pharaoh), it adds new insight or emphasis, rather than contradicting itself. The structure is recursive, thematic, and intentionally layered.

The Qur’an also responds to events in real time—yet its tone, message, and theology remain perfectly unified. This would be impossible for a man over 23 years to achieve without contradicting himself, unless guided by a higher source.

---

### 4. **The Qur’an Contains Fulfilled Prophecies**

There are several examples of **predictions in the Qur’an** that came true, some within the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him):

#### a. **Victory of the Romans (Byzantines)**

> **“The Romans have been defeated in the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will overcome. Within a few years. To God belongs the command before and after.”**
> *Surah ar-Rum (30:2–4)*

At the time this was revealed, the Romans had been crushed by the Persians and looked unlikely to recover. Yet, within a few years, the Romans decisively won, just as the Qur’an predicted. ([Byzantine-Sasanian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628))

#### b. **Promise of Islam’s Establishment**

> **God has promised those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession \[to authority] upon the earth...”**
> *Surah an-Nur (24:55)*

At a time when the Muslims were a persecuted minority in Mecca, this promise seemed impossible—but it was fulfilled with the eventual establishment of Islamic rule in Medina, and then across Arabia. It is imperative to note that the final conquest of Mecca was peaceful, with Muhammad (peace be upon him) announcing amnesty and forgiveness for all. ([Conquest of Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Mecca))

#### c. **Prophecy of Abu Lahab’s Fate**

> **“Perish the hands of Abu Lahab... his wealth and gains will not benefit him, and he will burn in a fire of blazing flame.”**
> *Surah al-Masad (111:1–3)*

[Abu Lahab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Lahab), a fierce opponent of Islam, lived for several years after this Surah was revealed. He could have disproven the Qur’an simply by pretending to accept Islam—but he never did. His continued opposition became a self-fulfilling prophecy.

### Final Reflection

The Qur’an presents a radically different model from the Bible:

* It claims **direct authorship by God**.
* It **guarantees its own preservation**, not relying on scribes, councils, or translators.
* It **welcomes scrutiny**, inviting readers to find contradictions if they can.
* It **contains prophecies** that came true in the Prophet’s own time.
* And it remains **unchanged**, recited by millions across centuries without variant.

If one were to apply the same tests to the Qur’an that expose the flaws of the Bible, the Qur’an passes each one unshaken. This is what you would expect of a Book from the Creator Himself.

Note on the Royal “We” Used in the Bible and the Qur'an
=======================================================

**The “We” in Genesis Isn’t Polytheism—It’s Majesty**

When [Genesis 1:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A26&version=NRSVUE) says, *“Let us make man in our image,”* some argue this proves a plural Godhead. But that interpretation misunderstands ancient Semitic language and context.

First, the **royal plural** or **majestic plural**—where a single ruler uses “we” instead of “I”—is common in Semitic languages and many others. Monarchs still say things like *“We are not amused”* today. It expresses **grandeur**, not **plurality**.

In **Hebrew**, the word for God—**Elohim**—is grammatically plural, but always paired with **singular verbs** when referring to the one God of Israel. *“Elohim created”* uses a singular verb, not plural, even though “Elohim” ends in -im.

Even in Genesis, the very next verse says:
*“So God created man in **His** own image”*—switching right back to **singular**. That alone invalidates the idea of a multi-person God speaking in verse 26.

Some scholars suggest God is speaking to the **heavenly court** (angels), who witness but do not create. Others see it simply as a **majestic literary device**.

And importantly, the **Qur’an** also uses “We” when Allah (the Arabic word for God—used by Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews as well as Muslims) speaks—yet no Muslim takes this to mean multiple gods. It’s clearly **linguistic, not theological**.

Even major Christian scholars admit this verse is not a doctrinal proof for the Trinity. It’s a shadow at best, and an overreach at worst.

Conclusion: One Perfect Word
============================

The Bible, examined on its own terms, bears undeniable marks of human hands: contradictions in its most sacred narratives, lost texts, theological confusion, and open admissions of personal opinion. Its canon was assembled through councils and conflict, not divine command. Even its language—like “Let us make man”—is often misunderstood and misused to justify doctrines the prophets (peace be upon them all) never taught.

Yet despite these flaws, the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus remains unchanged. His truth is not lost—it is preserved in the **Qur’an**, the only scripture that claims divine authorship, guarantees its own preservation, and challenges the reader to find a single contradiction within it. No scribe tampered with it. No emperor compiled it (however, ['Uthman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uthmanic_codex) did enforce the original recension of the Qur'an as collected by [Zayd ibn Thabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayd_ibn_Thabit)). It is whole, recited, memorized, and unchanged since the day it was revealed.

If God is perfect, His final Word must be perfect—free from confusion, contradiction, and corruption. The Bible points beyond itself. The Qur’an **is** that final, preserved Word: unambiguous, unbreakable, and uncompromising in its call to the One true God.

In my view, and the view of 2 billion Muslims, that is the truth, without doubt, for those willing to listen.

And Allah knows best.

*Ameen.*
